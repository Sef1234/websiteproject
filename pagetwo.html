        <p>  The Tomorrow war is the latest film from Amazon studios the digital streaming behemoth.
             The fact the one of the richest companies in the world is bankrolling the film can be gleaned from the budget of the film which stands at an eyewatering $200 million.
             Unfortunately, as is the case with many a blockbuster film, the hefty budget fails to translate into good storytelling.
             The film centres around Dan Forester played by Chris Pratt is a retired special forces operator turned high school teacher.
             Dan at the start of the story is trying to leverage his military background in order to land a lucrative job.
             However, his plans are scuppered when a group of soldiers form the future tear through space-time and land in Dan’s timeline.
             The desperate soldiers tell of a future war which is destroying the earth and threatening the survival of human beings on planet earth.
             Dan and his generation must help their future descendants win the war and ensure humanity’s survival.
             The hi-concept premise of the film is interesting and echoes the cultural anxiety over climate change which the current generation must fix if the future generation are to inherit a hospitable planet.
             The tantalising premise is sadly squandered by clunky characterisation, cliched set-pieces and a lead actor who fails to convince in the main role.
             Chris Pratt shot to stardom after he cemented his leading man credentials in both the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise and the reboot of the Jurassic Park franchise.
             In both of those leading roles he was allowed to express his humour which was honed after years on the hit TV sitcom Parks and Recreation.
             In The Tomorrow War Pratt has been lumped with a bland character who is a confusing mixture of an uber soldier, a soft-spoken high school teacher and a regretful dad.
             Shorn of his comedic wings Pratt trudges from one scene to the next with a sour unconvincing countenance. It does not help that he is surrounded by equally unconvincing character stereotypes.
             J.K. Simmons who is usually excellent is wasted in the role as Dan’s absentee father. Yvonne Strahovski always wears a grim expression in order to justify the shoe-horned in family drama.
             Some comedy relief arrives in the form of Charlie played by Sam Richardson who serves as one of the draftees for the future war alongside Dan.
             However, watching him one can’t help but wonder if Pratt himself would not have served better as the comedic foil.</p>

        <p>  Despite the poor roster of characters, the central premise and the high-budget demand some thrilling action and in this the film somewhat succeeds.
             There are plenty of explosion’s, CGI and real, action pieces are slick, fast paced and well shot.
             The CGI critters known as white spikes, responsible for causing the future war are terrifying creations and lend the film some genuinely tense moments.
             However, the problem is that none of this is new. The horde of CGI creatures over-running the land has become a staple of the sci-fi action genre.
             It is a safe way of producing conflict which does not offend anyone. Whilst watching The Tomorrow War a keen cinemagoer will be constantly reminded of other better films in the genre.
             Starship troopers, Aliens and Independence Day are just a few of the films from which The Tomorrow War has borrowed elements.
             An additional problem with the film is that a lot of the action is not only unfeasible but utterly unbelievable.
             On multiple occasions central characters survive explosions which would likely incinerate the average human.
             The white spike creatures are also problematic because they are depicted inconsistently.
             At times they seem invincible, and a barrage of bullets can’t stop them whilst at other times the lead character is able to punch them away.
             Boring characters, all too familiar tropes and some exasperating movie logic overshadow strands of exciting action in this expensive but dull offering from Amazon.
             If the streaming giants, who now have so much power in the film industry continue to produce such lacklustre stories than the future of film will look downright apocalyptic.</p>
