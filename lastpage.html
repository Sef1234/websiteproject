        <p> Even amongst Charlie Chaplin’s stellar filmography The Gold Rush stands out as a testament to his comedic genius and sheer creativity.
             Written, produced and directed by Chaplin in 1925, it would go on to become one of the highest grossing silent movies of all time and the film Chaplin himself wanted to be remembered for.
              The story was inspired by tragic events which occurred in mid 19th century when a group of gold prospectors had to resort to cannibalism after being trapped in the mountains.
               It is difficult to imagine that such harrowing events led to the creation of one of the greatest comedies of the silent era.
                The film centres around the character of The Lone Prospector which is a reprisal of the Tramp character which made Chaplin famous the world over.
                 In The Gold Rush the Tramp decides to become a gold prospector and heads for the unforgiving mountains of Alaska.
                  From the very start Chaplin alerts us to the fact that the character is out of his depth.
                   Shuffling along in his signature style with his feet pointing outwards, dressed in his customary garb and bowler hat, he walks along a mountainous path utterly unaware that a full-grown bear is trailing right behind him. Just as the oblivious Tramp pauses and looks behind him the bear disappears into a mountain cave.
                    However, the Tramp’s real problems begin when he is forced to shelter in a mountain cabin with another prospector Big Jim and a fugitive called Black Larsen.
                     The trio’s situation worsens when they run out of food and having sent Black Larsen out to look for food the Tramp and Big Jim begin to get desperate.
                      In a fit of hunger Big Jim hallucinates and begins to see the Tramp as a giant chicken. It is a bit which has since been repeated countless times in other films and TV shows.
                       How many times in the Looney Tunes or Tom and Jerry has one character been so overcome with hunger that they see another character as food. Chaplin’s influence on later comedies can be seen clearly through The Gold Rush.</p>

        <p> Seemingly unfunny moments become comedy gold in Chaplin’s hands. The events the film is inspired by describe that the men became so hungry they resorted to eating their shoes.
             The Tramp and Big Jim go through the same experience however Chaplin turns the whole thing into a carefully executed set-piece.
              The tramp takes pride in his cooking; poking and prodding the leathery shoe and holding off Big Jim who waits anxiously at the table for his disgusting meal.
               When the shoe is sufficiently cooked the Tramp fillets it like a fish and serves the laces like they are spaghetti.
                Their pathetic actions coupled with their sincerity is hilarious. The Gold Rush is not short on laughs, it keeps the gags coming one after the other which has helped solidify its status as one of the great comedies.
                 The set-pieces also benefit from stunning practical effects which elicit a genuine response from the audience.
                  The bear which stalks the Tramp is a real bear, when the wind batters the cabin we feel its force, when one of the character’s fall to his death in a mountain fall it looks and feels like it is really happening.
                   Films which use convincing practical effects stand out in our era which is dominated by unconvincing special effects.
                    Finally, it must be noted that the character of the Tramp perhaps Chaplin’s greatest creation, has a lot to do with the film’s enduring popularity.
                     He is a complex, fully fleshed out character who is at one time many things. He is arrogant and haughty but also kind and selfless. 
                     He consistently acts stupidly but at times also displays sharp instincts to foil Big Jim’s plans. Chaplin’s virtuosity as a performer and a filmmaker was key in bringing the character of Tramp to life.
                      He knew when to make him look a fool and when to evoke empathy for him. The character has of course become synonymous with the name Charlie Chaplin and The Gold Rush is one of the greatest adventures of the Tramp.</p>
