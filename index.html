        <h1>Helping you pick the best films!</h1>

        <p>We are obsessed with movies, especially the ones which lead to endless discussions around the water cooler and
           lead to heated debates with our loved ones. The great movies which you find yourself thinking about in the middle of the night!
           We help you choose the best movies for your entertainment and avoid box office trash!</p>

        <p>We not only review the latest offerings from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon but every week we do an in-depth analysis of a classic film.

        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p> At FilmReviews.com we like to think of ourselves as a community of passionate, like-minded movie nerds rather than an online business.
             We have all grown up watching movies and we all have our favourite movies and genres we enjoy.
             From action thrillers to slapstick comedies, Sci-Fiâ€™s to supernatural horrors everybody has a favourite genre of movies they like to wind down with.
             This is now easier than ever with digital studios like Amazon and Netflix gaining prominence in the film industry.<br> 
             With digital studios the process for film production, distribution and consumption has become increasingly streamlined. 
             This means new releases arrive at our screens often with little to no critical scrutiny and without facing rigorous competition at the box office.
             Unfortunately, this means that a lot of substandard films pop up in our recommended lists.<br>
             This is where our online community comes in. Our crack team of film-nerds are the first to watch and review the latest releases form the streaming services as well as traditional film studios.
             We analyse the films and upload our reviews as fast as possible so our readers can make the right picks for their viewing pleasure.
             We also upload weekly reviews of classic films which some of our readers might not be aware of. 
             These reviews are an opportunity for us to shed light on forgotten cinematic gems which our readers can enjoy.
             Our constant aim is to foster the community of film fans through our website and promote the appreciation of great films.</p>
